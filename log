- arrived 5x stm32 boards, swapping board seem to fix previous issues with flashing
- had a weird issue of gyro task not spawning after switching uart bluetooth pins
- switched off the board gave it a rest & the issue is not observed anymore
- tested with 25c battery, seems too weak to lift off, but did hover a little
- battery showed 3v with multimeter - probably almost discharged
- unable to check how much current drawn in total, seems multimeter is having a cap of 1a or just above that
- made a little harness out of thread to do stabilization; pretty fun to fire off the motors
